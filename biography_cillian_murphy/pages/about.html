            <h1>About Cillian Murphy</h1>
        <p>
            Murphy began collaborating with filmmaker Christopher Nolan in 2005, playing Dr. Jonathan Crane / Scarecrow in The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005–2012)<br>
            as well as appearing in Inception (2010) and Dunkirk (2017) and portraying the lead role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in the biographical epic Oppenheimer<br>
            (2023). He also gained prominence for his role as Tommy Shelby in the BBC period drama series Peaky Blinders (2013–2022) and for starring in the horror<br>
            sequel A Quiet Place Part II (2020). <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2011, Murphy won the Irish Times Theatre Award for Best Actor and Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Solo Performance for the one-man play Misterman.<br>
            In 2020, The Irish Times named him one of the greatest Irish film actors.<br>

            <h3>Early life</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            Murphy was born on 25 May 1976 in Douglas, Cork. His mother taught French while his father, Brendan, worked for the Department of Education. His grandfather, <br>
            aunts, and uncles were also teachers. He was raised in Ballintemple, Cork, alongside his younger brother Páidi and two younger sisters Sile and Orla. <br>
            He started writing and performing songs at the age of 10. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Murphy was raised Catholic and attended the fee-paying Catholic secondary school Presentation Brothers College, where he did well academically but often <br>
            got into trouble, sometimes being suspended; he decided in his fourth year that misbehaving was not worth the hassle.[4] Not keen on sports, which was a <br>
            major part of the school's curriculum, he found that artistic pursuits were neglected at the school. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Murphy began studying law at University College Cork (UCC) in 1996, but failed his first-year exams because he "had no ambitions to do it". Not only was <br>
            he busy with his band, but he knew within days after starting at UCC that law was not what he wanted to do. After seeing Corcadorca's stage production of <br>
            A Clockwork Orange, directed by Kiernan, acting began to garner his interest. His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society's amateur production of <br>
            Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme, which starred Irish-American comedian Des Bishop. Murphy also played the lead in their production <br>
            of Little Shop of Horrors, which was performed in the Cork Opera House. He later admitted that his primary motivation at the time was not to pursue an <br>
            acting career, but to go to parties and meet women. <br>

        </p>
        <p>
            Murphy pressured Pat Kiernan until he got an audition at Corcadorca Theatre Company, and in September 1996, he made his professional acting debut on the <br>
            stage, playing the part of a volatile Cork teenager in Enda Walsh's Disco Pigs. Walsh recalled meeting and discovering Murphy: "There was something about <br>
            him – he was incredibly enigmatic and he would walk into a room with real presence and you'd go, "My God". It had nothing to do with those bloody eyes <br>
            that everyone's going on about all the time." Murphy observed, "I was unbelievably cocky and had nothing to lose, and it suited the part, I suppose." <br>
            Originally intended to run for three weeks in Cork, Disco Pigs ended up touring throughout Europe, Canada and Australia for two years, and Murphy left <br>
            both university and his band. Though he had intended to go back to playing music, he secured representation after his first agent caught a performance of <br>
            Disco Pigs, and his acting career began to take off. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            He starred in many other theatre productions, including Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing (1998), The Country Boy, and Juno and the Paycock (both 1999). <br>
            He began appearing in independent films such as On the Edge (2001), and in short films, including Filleann an Feall (2000) and Watchmen (2001). He also <br>
            reprised his role for the film adaption of Disco Pigs (2001) and appeared in the BBC television mini-series adaptation of The Way We Live Now. During this <br>
            period, he moved from Cork, relocating first to Dublin for a few years, then to London in 2001. <br>
